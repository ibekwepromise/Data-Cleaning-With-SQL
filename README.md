## INTRODUCTION
In the realm of data analysis, the adage "garbage in, garbage out" underscores the importance of data cleanliness. Before any meaningfull insights can be drawn, raw data must undergo rigorous cleaning preparation. In this case of the Nasville Hosing Dataset, this initial step is paramount to ensure accurate and realiable analysis.

## DATASET OVERVIEW
This Dataset was gotten from Github, initially posted on Kaggle.
I used Microsoft SQL Server to carryout this data manipulation. 

## PROJECT OBJECTIVE
Through SQL queries tailored to address specific data cleaning tasks, we will navigate through the intricacies of Nashville Housing Dataset. From standardizing format to populating column, spliting columns and creating individual columns, finding and replacing misspelled words, removing duplicate rows and deleting unwanted columns. Each step in the data cleaning process plays a vital role in enchancing the dataset's integrity and usability.
